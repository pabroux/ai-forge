Trainer

        trainer__num_nodes: Number of GPU nodes for distributed training. Default 1
        trainer__sync_batchnorm: In distributed training, if batchnorm is applied, setting it to True to assess batchnorm by taking into
            account all device (recommanded if you have small batch size). False to have a batchnorm by device
        trainer__precision: Precision to use for the training. Default 32
        trainer__gradient_clip_val: Setting infinity gradient to that value, by default we use 0
        trainer__reload_dataloaders_every_n_epoch: Reloading dataloader at n epochs. Default 0

        trainer__val_check_interval: Applying how often within one training epoch to check the validation set

            the whole validation. Default 2
        trainer__benchmark: Setting to True can increase the speed of your system if your input sizes don't change. However, if they do,
            then it might make your system slower. CUDNN auto-tuner will try to find the best algorithm for the hardware when a new input
            size is encountered

        trainer__overfit_batches: DEBUGGING - Overfitting on a same batch. If you don't have an overfitting, then you have a problem. Set
            1 for selecting a single batch and overfitting that batch. A float, for a percent of the training data. No shuffle
